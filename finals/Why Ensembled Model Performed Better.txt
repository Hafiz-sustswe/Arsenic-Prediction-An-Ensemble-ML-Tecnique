The ensemble architecture of combining Linear Regression, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), and Random Forest performed better than their individual results due to several key factors that harness the strengths of each model while mitigating their weaknesses. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. Diversity of Models:
Each individual model (Linear Regression, SVR, Random Forest) has its own strengths and weaknesses:

Linear Regression: Assumes a linear relationship between features and target. It's simple and interpretable but struggles with non-linear relationships and outliers.
Support Vector Regressor (SVR): Handles non-linear relationships well through the use of kernels but can be sensitive to the choice of parameters and scale of the data.
Random Forest: Averages multiple decision trees, reducing overfitting and handling non-linear relationships, but can be less interpretable and sometimes biased towards dominant features.

2. Reduction of Bias and Variance:
Bias: Linear Regression has high bias (underfitting) in non-linear settings, while Random Forest and SVR have lower bias due to their capacity to capture more complex patterns.
Variance: Random Forest reduces variance through averaging, but SVR and Linear Regression can have higher variance. Combining these models balances the overall bias-variance trade-off.

3. Aggregation of Predictions:

By combining predictions from Linear Regression, SVR, and Random Forest, the ensemble model benefits from the strengths of each model:
Linear Regression provides a strong baseline for linear trends.
SVR captures complex, non-linear relationships.
Random Forest offers robustness to overfitting and captures intricate interactions between features.
The final prediction is an aggregation (e.g., weighted average) of these models, smoothing out individual model errors and enhancing generalization.

4. Robustness and Stability:

Robustness: The ensemble model is more robust to overfitting, as Random Forest and SVR contribute to capturing non-linearities and interactions, while Linear Regression prevents extreme overfitting by maintaining simplicity.
Stability: The ensemble model is more stable as it averages out the noise and reduces the impact of any single modelâ€™s poor performance on specific subsets of data.

5. Complementary Strengths:
Linear Regression: Provides interpretability and handles linear relationships.
SVR: Adds flexibility to model complex, non-linear relationships.
Random Forest: Enhances model robustness and captures feature interactions without requiring detailed tuning.

6. Error Compensation:
Individual models may make different errors on the same data points. When these models are combined, the errors can cancel out, leading to improved overall performance.
For example, if Linear Regression underestimates a particular pattern, SVR or Random Forest might compensate by accurately capturing that pattern, leading to a more accurate ensemble prediction.
